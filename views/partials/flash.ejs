<!-- partial for flashing messages and given role of alert for accessibility purposes in bootstrap -->
<!-- i.e its for screen reader ,they otherwise wouldn't know that there was an alert  -->
<!-- to make only run when their success we'll add some logic -->
<!-- by default success its an empty array i.e if their nothing in that success it means its an empty array -->
<!-- so empty array is not success -->
<!-- checking for if their is an success and its not empty i.e 0 length is false -->

<% if(success && success.length) {%>
<div class="alert alert-success alert-dismissible fade show" role="alert">
    <!-- displaying our success variable -->
    <%=success %> 
    <button type="button" class="btn-close" data-bs-dismiss="alert" aria-label="Close"></button>

</div>

<% } %> 
<!-- we only want this to show up on the page if there is anything in success -->
